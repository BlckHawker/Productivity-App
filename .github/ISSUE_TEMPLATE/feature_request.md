### Summary
<!-- A short, clear description of the feature or improvement -->

**Example:**  
Allow users to create tasks with multiple reminder times instead of just one.

---

### Problem
<!-- Describe the current limitation or problem this feature would solve -->

**Example:**  
Right now, users can only set one reminder per task. For important tasks, I want reminders at multiple intervals (e.g., 1 day before and 1 hour before).

---

### Proposed Solution
<!-- Describe your idea for how the feature should work -->

**Example:**  
Add a new “+ Add Reminder” button to the reminder section of the task editor. Each reminder could be managed individually and scheduled relative to the task’s planned time or deadline.

---

### Alternatives Considered
<!-- List any alternative ideas or workarounds you've thought about -->

**Example:**  
I tried creating duplicate tasks with different reminders, but that’s cluttered and hard to manage.

### Screenshots or Media (Optional)
<!-- Add mockups, diagrams, or references if helpful -->

---

### Additional Context
<!-- Any other relevant info about the feature request -->

**Example:**  
This would be especially helpful for time-sensitive tasks like appointments, flights, or critical project deadlines.
